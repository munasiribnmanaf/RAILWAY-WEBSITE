                In 1951, the Indian Railways was established by the amalgamation of 42 different railway companies
                operating in the country, spanning a total of 55,000 km (34,000 mi). The railway network across the
                country was reorganized into six regional zones in 1951–52 for administrative purposes, which was
                gradually expanded to 18 zones over the years.

                The first steam operated railway operated in 1837 in Madras with the first passenger operating in 1853
                between Bombay and Thane. In 1925, the first electric train ran in Bombay on DC traction. The first
                locomotive manufacturing unit was commissioned in 1950 at Chittaranjan with the first coach
                manufacturing unit set-up at Madras in 1955.
